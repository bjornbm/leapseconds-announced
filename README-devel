The file Data/Time/Clock/AnnouncedLeapSeconds.hs is automatically
generated by MakeLeapSecondTable.hs (and as such perhaps shouldn't
really be stored in the repo). E.g.:

  ghc --make MakeLeapSecondTable.hs
  curl http://www.celestrak.com/SpaceData/eop19620101.txt | ./MakeLeapSecondTable > Data/Time/Clock/AnnouncedLeapSeconds.hs

Note that to compile MakeLeapSeconds.hs one needs the as of yet
unreleased astro library (git://github.com/bjornbm/astro.git).
