Provides a static 'Data.Time.Clock.TAI.LeapSecondTable' \"containing\"
the leap seconds announced at library release time. This version
will become invalidated when/if the International Earth Rotation
and Reference Systems Service (IERS) announces a new leap second at
<http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat>.
At that time a new version of the library will be released, against
which any code wishing to remain up to date should be recompiled.

This module is intended to provide a quick-and-dirty leap second solution
for one-off analyses concerned only with the past and present (i.e. up
until the next as of yet unannounced leap second), or for applications
which can afford to be recompiled against an updated library as often
as every six months.

-- | List of all leap seconds up to 2017-01-01. An
-- estimate of hypothetical leap seconds prior to 1972-01-01 is
-- included. These can be understood as leap seconds that may have
-- been introduced had UTC used the SI second since its inception in 1961.
-- One should be extremely careful in using this information as it is
-- generally not appropriate. One specific case where it may be useful
-- is in reducing the error in computed time differences between UTC time
-- stamps in the 1961--1971 range from the order of 10 SI seconds to 1 SI
-- second.
